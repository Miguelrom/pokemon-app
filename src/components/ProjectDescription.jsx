      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>
        This project is based on the Pok√©mon App development requested for the fourth stage of the Student of Excellence 2020
        contest of NearSoft, Inc. <br />
        The main purpose of the web application is to serve as an exercise to acquire skills in
        frontend web development, particularly in the use of the <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a> library. <br />
        Another goal of this project is to have it as a demo in my personal portfolio for potential employers.
